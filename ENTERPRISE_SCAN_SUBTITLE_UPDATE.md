## 🎯 Purpose of Change

The new subtitle better reflects the **enterprise-grade security assessment** capabilities:

### Old Subtitle Focus:
- ❌ Generic: "Cloud-Based Multi-Engine Detection"

- ❌ Doesn't convey enterprise value

### New Subtitle Benefits:
- ✅ **Professional**: "Enterprise-level"
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: "device security posture assessment"
- ✅ **Clear value proposition**: Positions as enterprise solution
- ✅ **Matches industry terminology**: "Security posture" is standard enterprise term

## 🏢 Enterprise Context

The term **"security posture assessment"** is widely used in enterprise security:

- **NIST Framework**: Uses "security posture" extensively
- **ISO 27001**: References security posture assessments
- **Enterprise Security Teams**: Standard terminology

This change aligns the app's messaging with **enterprise security standards**.
